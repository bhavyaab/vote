# vote

In a school fair the kids were asked to put their own stole and sale some items in order to demonstrate their sales skills. To make sure a successful sales event one smart kid got an idea for taking votes for item they were thinking can make a great sale. In order to get vote they come up with an idea of using app that displays potential products to individuals in focus groups (three products at a time, side-by-side-by-side.

- This app will count for clicks and give results of top 5 most liked product.
- It will also count the time spend on each item so that it could be considered as attention gainning product.
